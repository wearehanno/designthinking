# The Remote Product Design Sprint wiki

**Note: We're no longer actively maintaining this wiki**.

As of 2021-02-25, it has been quite some time since individual pages of this wiki have been updated. This has coincided with a shift in our focus as a team, and our movement into the health space. We do still run remote product design sprints, but we do so less frequently than when they were our primary tool for working with clients across many different industries.

You may still find value in some of the pages inside this wiki, but we are archiving it for now.

Good luck!

This is where we're storing all of our internal notes about how our Remote Product Design Sprint works.

We know - things in here are a little scrappy and if you're a non-designer, might be hard to grasp. As we build out and document our way of working better, we'll add much more detail in here.

In the meantime, if you're looking for help running your own remote Product Design Sprint, [send us a message](https://hanno.co/contact)!
